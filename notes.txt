every mysql function according to it's type, mysql, mysqli or pdo has a prefix.
mysqli_ ... and so on.
some of the mysqli function that I can recall:

mysqli_fetch_row
mysqli_fetch_assoc -> not sure about that

I've come to realise that if I dont learn well those functions I'll always have difficulties about the basic
functionnality of the database management systems so lets learn them.

the first and most important is mysqli_connect(S.U.P.D);

and the other is mysqli_disconnet();
We usually add that function in the footer, when page loading is finished logically mysql connection should be ended.
